# Variable_Stars
Repository with programs used in the determination of physical parameters in variable stars, with main focus in RR Lyreaes.

The file named "variables" is the program that unifies all other individual programs in this repo, it takes the photometric files of a globular cluster and a table with info about the period an the epoch of maximum brightness. The outcome os the program are a ton of grpahics of all light curves, and another bunch of tables ands logs of nonexisting files, stars whithout enough data etc. Most importantly, it gives the bailey graph for the cluster and the calculated physical parameters (Metalicity in various scales, distance, aproximate mass etc.). It is my Opus Magnum at the moment.

"Aj_int" is a complementary program, it can refine individual stars of the cluster, searching for an optimal period, an adecuate epoch, and it helps with some phase shift in the data.
